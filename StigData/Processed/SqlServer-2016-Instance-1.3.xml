      <RawString>Review the system documentation to determine whether any limits have been defined. If it does not, assume a limit of 10 for database administrators and 2 for all other users. 
 
If a mechanism other than a logon trigger is used, verify its correct operation by the appropriate means. If it does not work correctly, this is a finding.  
 
Otherwise, determine if a logon trigger exists:  
 
In SQL Server Management Studio's Object Explorer tree:  
Expand [SQL Server Instance] &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Server Objects &gt;&gt; Triggers  
 
OR 
 
Run the query:  
SELECT name FROM master.sys.server_triggers;  
 
If no triggers are listed, this is a finding.  
 
If triggers are listed, identify the one(s) limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user. If none are found, this is a finding. If they are present but disabled, this is a finding.  
 
Examine the trigger source code for logical correctness and for compliance with the documented limit(s). If errors or variances exist, this is a finding.  
 
Verify that the system does execute the trigger(s) each time a user session is established. If it does not operate correctly for all types of user, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <RawString>Determine whether SQL Server is configured to use only Windows authentication.  
 
In the Object Explorer in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), right-click on the server instance. 
Select "Properties".  
Select the Security page.  
 
If Windows Authentication Mode is selected, this is not a finding.  
 
OR 
 
In a query interface such as the SSMS Transact-SQL editor, run the statement:  
SELECT CASE SERVERPROPERTY('IsIntegratedSecurityOnly')    
WHEN 1 THEN 'Windows Authentication'    
WHEN 0 THEN 'Windows and SQL Server Authentication'    
END as [Authentication Mode]  
 
If the returned value in the "Authentication Mode" column is "Windows Authentication", this is not a finding.  
 
Mixed mode (both SQL Server authentication and Windows authentication) is in use. If the need for mixed mode has not been documented and approved, this is a finding.  
 
From the documentation, obtain the list of accounts authorized to be managed by SQL Server.  
 
Determine the accounts (SQL Logins) actually managed by SQL Server. Run the statement:  
 
SELECT name 
FROM sys.sql_logins 
WHERE type_desc = 'SQL_LOGIN' AND is_disabled = 0;  
 
If any accounts listed by the query are not listed in the documentation, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <RawString>If the SQL Server is not part of an Active Directory domain, this finding is Not Applicable. 
 
Obtain the fully qualified domain name of the SQL Server instance: 
 
Launch Windows Explorer. 
 
Right-click on "Computer" or "This PC" (Varies by OS level), click "Properties". 
 
Note the value shown for "Full computer name". 
 
*** Note: For a cluster, this value must be obtained from the Failover Cluster Manager. *** 
 
Obtain the TCP port that is supporting the SQL Server instance: 
 
Click Start &gt;&gt; Type "SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager" &gt;&gt; From the search results, click "SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager". 
 
From the tree on the left, expand "SQL Server Network Configuration". 
 
Click "Protocols for &lt;Instance Name&gt;" where &lt;Instance Name&gt; is the name of the instance (MSSQLSERVER is the default name). 
 
In the right pane, right-click on "TCP/IP" and choose "Properties". 
 
In the window that opens, click the "IP Addresses" tab. 
 
Note the TCP port configured for the instance. 
 
Obtain the service account that is running the SQL Server service: 
 
Click "Start".  
Type "SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager".  
From the search results, click "SQL Server 2016 Configuration Manager". 
 
From the tree on the left, select "SQL Server Services". 
 
Note the account listed in the "Log On As" column for the SQL Server instance being reviewed. 
 
Launch a command-line or PowerShell window. 
 
Enter the following command where &lt;Service Account&gt; is the identity of the service account. 
 
setspn -L &lt;Service Account&gt; 
 
Example:  setspn -L CONTOSO\sql2016svc 
 
Review the Registered Service Principal Names returned.  
 
If the listing does not contain the following two service principal names, this is a finding. 
 
MSSQLSvc/&lt;Fully Qualified Domain Name&gt; 
MSSQLSvc/&lt;Fully Qualified Domain Name&gt;:&lt;TCP Port&gt; 
 
If the MSSQLSvc service is registered for any fully qualified domain names that do not match the current server, this may indicate the service account is shared across SQL Server instances. Review server documentation, if the sharing of service accounts across instances is not documented and authorized, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <RawString>Obtain the list of authorized SQL Server accounts in the system documentation.  
 
Determine if any accounts are shared. A shared account is defined as a username and password that are used by multiple individuals to log into SQL Server. An example of a shared account is the SQL Server installation account. Windows Groups are not shared accounts as the group itself does not have a password. 
 
If accounts are determined to be shared, determine if individuals are first individually authenticated.  
 
If individuals are not individually authenticated before using the shared account (e.g., by the operating system or possibly by an application making calls to the database), this is a finding.  
 
The key is individual accountability. If this can be traced, this is not a finding.  
 
If accounts are determined to be shared, determine if they are directly accessible to end users. If so, this is a finding.  
 
Review contents of audit logs, traces and data tables to confirm that the identity of the individual user performing the action is captured.  
 
If shared identifiers are found, and not accompanied by individual identifiers, this is a finding.  
 
Note: Privileged installation accounts may be required to be accessed by the DBA or other administrators for system maintenance. In these cases, each use of the account must be logged in some manner to assign accountability for any actions taken during the use of the account.</RawString>

      <RawString>The common language runtime (CLR) component of the .NET Framework for Microsoft Windows in SQL Server allows you to write stored procedures, triggers, user-defined types, user-defined functions, user-defined aggregates, and streaming table-valued functions, using any .NET Framework language, including Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C#.  CLR packing assemblies can access resources protected by .NET Code Access Security when it runs managed code.  Specifying UNSAFE enables the code in the assembly complete freedom to perform operations in the SQL Server process space that can potentially compromise the robustness of SQL Server. UNSAFE assemblies can also potentially subvert the security system of either SQL Server or the common language runtime.  
 
To determine if CLR is enabled, execute the following commands:  
 
EXEC SP_CONFIGURE 'show advanced options', '1';

      <RawString>Extended stored procedures are DLLs that an instance of SQL Server can dynamically load and run. Extended stored procedures run directly in the address space of an instance of SQL Server and are programmed by using the SQL Server Extended Stored Procedure API.   
 
Non-Standard extended stored procedures can compromise the integrity of the SQL Server process.  This feature will be removed in a future version of Microsoft SQL Server. Do not use this feature in new development work, and modify applications that currently use this feature as soon as possible.  
 
To determine if non-standard extended stored procedures exist, run the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE [master]

      <RawString>A linked server allows for access to distributed, heterogeneous queries against OLE DB data sources. After a linked server is created, distributed queries can be run against this server, and queries can join tables from more than one data source. If the linked server is defined as an instance of SQL Server, remote stored procedures can be executed. 
 
To obtain a list of linked servers, execute the following command:  
 
EXEC sp_linkedservers;

SQL Server Residual Information Protection (RIP) requires a memory allocation to be overwritten with a known pattern of bits before memory is reallocated to a new resource. Meeting the RIP standard can contribute to improved security; however, overwriting the memory allocation can slow performance. After the common criteria compliance enabled option is enabled, the overwriting occurs.
