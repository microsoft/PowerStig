      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.

These attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies; reflect special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions; or support other aspects of the information security policy.

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security attributes may be assigned manually or during data processing but, either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security attributes are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.

The sensitivity marking or labeling of stored data items promotes the correct handling and protection of data.  Without such notification, the user may unwittingly disclose sensitive data to unauthorized users.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the premise that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

The DBMS must ensure the recipient of object permissions possesses only the access intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit unauthorized rights propagation. If propagation is not prevented, users can continue to grant rights to other users without limit.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;true&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.

The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation.  When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases.  When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections).  SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database.  SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code.  To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.

Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on.  This provides an opportunity for misuse.

When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner.  This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL2-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL2-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...).   The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role.  The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].

Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.

Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles.  Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.

The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and system information.  Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Applications and application users generate information throughout the course of their application use.

User-generated data, as well as, application-specific configuration data, needs to be protected. Configurations and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

If the confidentiality and integrity of SQL Server data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.

Protective measures include encryption, physical security of the facility where the storage devices reside, operating system file permissions, and organizational controls.

Privileges granted outside the role of the application user job function are more likely to go unmanaged or without oversight for authorization. Maintenance of privileges using roles defined for discrete job functions offers improved oversight of application user privilege assignments and helps to protect against unauthorized privilege assignment.

SQL Server built-in administrative privileges, built-in server roles and built-in database roles must not be assigned directly to administrative user accounts (that is, server logins and database users). If administrative user accounts have direct access to administrative roles, this access must be removed, with the exception of administrative roles that the DBMS assigns to the special database principal [dbo], and will not allow to be altered.

The built-in server role "sysadmin" is a partial exception. This cannot be granted to a user-defined role, only to a login account. Most (not necessarily all) database administrators will need to be members of sysadmin. Without this, most DBCC commands and the system stored procedures/functions listed below are unavailable.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;When data is written to digital media, such as hard drives, mobile computers, external/removable hard drives, personal digital assistants, flash/thumb drives, etc., there is risk of data loss and/or compromise.

An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations need to document, in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict access.

Fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed the physical access controls where the media resides provide adequate protection.

As part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. The decision whether to employ cryptography is the responsibility of the information owner/steward, who exercises discretion within the framework of applicable rules, policies and law. The selection of the cryptographic mechanisms used is based upon maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

The strength of mechanisms is commensurate with the classification and sensitivity of the information.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application’s data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

SQL Server needs to validate the data user’s attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

A poorly designed database system can have many problems. A common issue with these types of systems is the missed opportunity to use constraints.

While this matter is of great importance to the secure operation of database management systems, the DBA in a typical installation will communicate with the application development/support staff to obtain assurance that this requirement is met.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.

The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation.  When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases.  When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections).  SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database.  SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code.  To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.

Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on.  This provides an opportunity for misuse.

When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner.  This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL2-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL2-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...).   The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role.  The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].

Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.

Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles.  Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.

The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

If any of the audit event IDs required above is not listed, this is a finding.

Notes:
1. It is acceptable to have the required event IDs spread across multiple traces, provided all of the traces are always active, and the event IDs are grouped in a logical manner.
2. It is acceptable, from an auditing point of view, to include the same event IDs in multiple traces.  However, the effect of this redundancy on performance, storage, and the consolidation of audit logs into a central repository, should be taken into account.
3. It is acceptable to trace additional event IDs. This is the minimum list.
4. Once this check is satisfied, the DBA may find it useful to disable or modify the default trace that is set up by the SQL Server installation process. (Note that the Fix does NOT include code to do this.)  
Use the following query to obtain a list of all event IDs, and their meaning:
     SELECT * FROM sys.trace_events; 
5. Because this check procedure is designed to address multiple requirements/vulnerabilities, it may appear to exceed the needs of some individual requirements.  However, it does represent the aggregate of all such requirements.
6. Microsoft has flagged the trace techniques and tools used in this Check and Fix as deprecated.  They will be removed at some point after SQL Server 2014.  The replacement feature is Extended Events.  If Extended Events are in use, and cover all the required audit events listed above, this is not a finding.</RawString>
