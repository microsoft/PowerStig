      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A .Net assembly will satisfy the Publisher Membership Condition if it is signed with a software publisher’s Authenticode X.509v3 digital certificate that can be verified by the Windows operating system as having a chain of trust that leads to a trusted root certificate stored in the user’s certificate store. The Publisher Membership Condition can be used to identify an organization, developer, vendor, or other entity as the ultimate source of the assembly, even if the code itself was obtained from a third party, such as a mirror site. Access to system resources, such as file systems or printers, may then be granted to the assembly based on the trust relationship with the identified entity.

Success

An assembly will satisfy the StrongNameMembershipCondition if its metadata contains the strongly identifying data associated with the specified strong name. At the least, this means it has been digitally signed with the private key associated with the public key recorded in the policy.

The presence of the encryption key values in the StrongName field indicates the use of StrongNameMembershipCondition. 

If a Strong Name Membership Condition is assigned to a non-default Code Group the private key must be adequately protected by the software developer or the entity responsible for signing the assemblies. 

Ask the Systems Programmer how the private keys are protected. 

Private keys are simply values stored as strings of data.  Keys can be stored in files on the file system or in a centralized data repository. 

Adequate protection methods include, but are not limited to:
- utilizing centralized key management;
- using strict file permissions to limit access; and
- tying strong pass phrases to the key.

If the private key used to sign the assembly is not adequately protected, this is a finding.</RawString>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Note: Microsoft recommends using the Windows Communication Framework (WCF) rather than using .Net remoting. New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible.

.NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process.  Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity.

Normally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. 

Due to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. 

Microsoft provides 3 different "channels" that are used for remoting.  They are HTTP, TCP and IPC.

Any unauthorized use of a remoting application provides unauthorized access with FullTrust permissions to the system. This can potentially result in a loss of system integrity or confidentiality.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <RawString>Review the machine.config file and the [application name].exe.config file.

For 32 bit systems, the "machine.config" file is contained in the following folder. %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config 

For 64 bit systems, the "machine.config" file is contained in the following folder. %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config.

Microsoft specifies locating the [application].config file in the same folder as the application executable (.exe) file. However, the developer does have the capability to specify a different location when the application is compiled.  Therefore, if the file is not found in the application home folder, a search of the system is required. If the [application name].exe.config file is not found on the system, then only a check of the machine.config file is required.

Sample machine/application config file:

&lt;application name=“remoteserver”&gt; 
  &lt;service&gt; 
    &lt;activated type=“sample.my.object, myobjects”/&gt; 
  &lt;/service&gt; 
  &lt;channels&gt; 
    &lt;channel ref=“http server” port=“80”/&gt; 
  &lt;/channels&gt; 
&lt;/application&gt;

&lt;serverProviders&gt;
  &lt;provider ref="wsdl" /&gt;
  &lt;formatter ref="soap" typeFilterLevel="Low" /&gt; 
  &lt;formatter ref="binary" typeFilterLevel="Low" /&gt; 
&lt;/serverProviders&gt; 

Microsoft provides 3 "channels" that are used for remoting connectivity.  They are the HTTP, TCP and IPC channels.  The channel that is used is specified via the &lt;channels&gt; element in the config file.  

HTTP channel example:
&lt;channel ref=“http server” port=“80”/&gt; 

The HTTP Channel only supports encryption and message integrity when the remote object is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) using TLS.

The above example shows the well known TLS port of 443 is not being used. 

If the HTTP remoting channel is not configured to protect the channel by using TLS encryption, this is a finding.

Click on each of the files, view properties, and click version tab to determine the version installed.  If there is no Mscorlib.dll, there is no installed version of .Net Framework in that directory.

More specific information on determining versions of .Net Framework installed can be found at the following link. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;FIPS encryption is configured via .NET configuration files.  There are numerous configuration files that affect different aspects of .Net behavior.  The .NET config files are described below.
 
Machine Configuration Files:
The machine configuration file, Machine.config, contains settings that apply to an entire computer. This file is located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config directory for 32 bit .NET 4 installations and %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config for 64 bit systems.   Machine.config contains configuration settings for machine-wide assembly binding, built-in remoting channels, and ASP.NET.

Application Configuration Files:
Application configuration files contain settings specific to an application. If checking these files, a .NET review of a specific .NET application is most likely being conducted. These files contain configuration settings that the Common Language Runtime reads (such as assembly binding policy, remoting objects, and so on), and settings that the application can read. 

The name and location of the application configuration file depends on the application's host, which can be one of the following: 

Executable–hosted application configuration files. 

The configuration file for an application hosted by the executable host is in the same directory as the application. The name of the configuration file is the name of the application with a .config extension. For example, an application called myApp.exe can be associated with a configuration file called myApp.exe.config. 

Internet Explorer-hosted application configuration files. 

If an application hosted in Internet Explorer has a configuration file, the location of this file is specified in a &lt;link&gt; tag with the following syntax.

&lt;link rel="ConfigurationFileName" href="location"&gt;

In this tag, "location" represents a URL that point to the configuration file. This sets the application base. The configuration file must be located on the same web site as the application. 

.NET 4.0 allows the CLR runtime to be configured to ignore FIPS encryption requirements.  If the CLR is not configured to use FIPS encryption modules, insecure encryption modules might be employed which could introduce an application confidentiality or integrity issue.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;In the .NET Framework version 3.5 and earlier versions, if an application assembly loaded code/objects from a remote location, that assembly would run partially trusted with a permissions grant set that depended on the zone in which it was loaded. For example, if an assembly was loaded from a web site, it was loaded into the Internet zone and granted the Internet permission set. In other words, it was executed in an Internet sandbox.

If the same program is run in the .NET Framework version 4, an exception is thrown which effectively states; either explicitly create a sandbox for the assembly or run it in full trust.

The &lt;loadFromRemoteSources&gt; element specifies the assemblies that run partially trusted in earlier versions of the .NET Framework will be run fully trusted in the .NET Framework 4.

If loadFromRemoteSources is set to true, the remotely loaded application code is granted full trust.  This could create an integrity vulnerability on the system.  The required method to address this is to explicitly create a sandboxed environment for the remotely loaded code to run in rather than allowing remotely loaded code to run with full trust.

The appropriate level of trust must be established prior to enabling the loading of remote code in .Net 4 applications and that code must be run in a controlled environment.  The following is an example of the use of loadFromRemoteSources.

&lt;configuration&gt;
&lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true" "https://my.dodorg.gov" /&gt;
    &lt;loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true" "https://192.168.0.*" /&gt;

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;With the advent of .Net 4.0, the .Net framework no longer directly configures or enforces security policy for .Net applications.  This task is now relegated to the operating system layer and the security protections built-in to .Net application "runtime hosts" that run on the O.S. 

Examples of these .Net "runtime hosts" include; Internet Explorer, Windows Shell, ASP.NET, Database Engines or any other "runtime hosts" that utilize .Net and load the .Net CLR.

Security protections include utilizing runtime host security controls such as sandboxing to restrict or control application behavior as designed or required.  

To compensate for these design changes, Windows provides native solutions such as Software Security Policies (SSP) and Application Locker (AL) which are technologies that can be implemented via Group Policy (GPO).  SSP, AL and similar third party solutions serve to restrict execution of applications, scripts and libraries based upon cryptographic hash, security zones, path and certificate values that are associated with the application files.  Additionally, application developers will utilize "sandboxing" techniques within their code in order to isolate 3rd party code libraries from critical system resources.

In order to assign protections to .Net 4.0 applications, the applications must first be identified and the appropriate hosting security mechanisms configured to accomplish that task.  

.Net STIG guidance cannot be applied if .Net applications are not identified and documented.  The lack of an application inventory introduces confidentiality, availability and integrity vulnerabilities to the system.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Note: Microsoft recommends using the Windows Communication Framework (WCF) rather than .Net remoting. New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible.

.NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process.  Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity.

Normally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. 

Due to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. 

Microsoft provides 3 different "channels" that are used for remoting.  They are HTTP, TCP and IPC.

Any unauthorized use of a remoting application provides unauthorized access with FullTrust permissions to the system. This can potentially result in a loss of system integrity or confidentiality.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>

Check the machine.config and the [application executable name].exe.config configuration files. 

For 32 bit systems, the "machine.config" file is contained in the following folder. %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config 

For 64 bit systems, the "machine.config" file is contained in the following folder. %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config.

Microsoft specifies locating the application config file in the same folder as the application executable (.exe) file. However, the developer does have the capability to specify a different location when the application is compiled.  Therefore, if the config file is not found in the application home folder, a search of the system is required. If the [application name].exe.config file is not found on the system, then only a check of the machine.config file is required.

Sample machine/application config file:

&lt;application name=“remoteserver”&gt; 
  &lt;service&gt; 
    &lt;activated type=“sample.my.object, myobjects”/&gt; 
  &lt;/service&gt; 
  &lt;channels&gt; 
    &lt;channel ref=“tcp server” port=“6134”/&gt;

&lt;serverProviders&gt;
  &lt;provider ref="wsdl" /&gt;
  &lt;formatter ref="soap" typeFilterLevel="Full" /&gt; 
  &lt;formatter ref="binary" typeFilterLevel="Full" /&gt; 
&lt;/serverProviders&gt; 

Microsoft provides 3 "channels" that are used for remoting connectivity.  They are the HTTP, TCP, and IPC channels.  The channel that is used is specified via the &lt;channels&gt; element in the config file.  

TCP channel example:
&lt;channel ref=“tcp” port=“6134” secure="true"/&gt; 

The TCP Channel provides encryption and message integrity when the 'secure' flag is set to true as shown in the above example.

If the secure flag is not set to "true" for the TCP channel, this is a finding.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Microsoft Windows operating systems provide a feature called Authenticode.  Authenticode technology and its underlying code signing mechanisms serve to provide a structure to identify software publishers and ensure that software applications have not been tampered with.  Authenticode technology relies on digital certificates and is based on Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7 (encrypted key specification), PKCS #10 (certificate request formats), X.509 (certificate specification), and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and MD5 hash algorithms.

The manner in which the Authenticode technology validates a certificate and determines what is considered a valid certificate can be modified to meet the mission of the Microsoft Windows system.

      <Description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Use of the RC4 cipher in TLS could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and recover plaintext from encrypted sessions. Applications that target .Net version 4.x running on multiple Windows versions could be vulnerable to these types of attacks. The registry settings in this requirement will prevent .Net applications that target the 4.x framework from selecting and utilizing the Schannel.dll RC4 cipher for TLS connections. Applications that use TLS when connecting to remote systems will perform a handshake and negotiate the TLS version and cipher that is to be used between the client and the server. This is standard protocol for all TLS connections. If the server and client are not configured to use the same TLS version and cipher, the TLS connection may fail. Applications should be tested with these registry settings prior to production implementation of the fix in order to avoid application outages.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</Description>
